General purpose maven plugins and extensions

## Plugin list

- **[mixin-maven-plugin](../../blob/master/mixin-maven-plugin/README.md)** - A Maven extension that let a pom developer import other pom files properties and pluginManagement sections without inherting them or copy/paste. See [mixin-maven-plugin](../../blob/master/mixin-maven-plugin/README.md)
